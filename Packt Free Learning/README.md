This scenario was designed to scrape the Packt Free Learning Page Page, and Output to an RSS feed.

## Author Notes
This scenario uses Phantom JS, and is set to 1 hour. I recommend that you set this to a time of day relative to the time that Packt releases. I believe they release in the `Europe/London` timezone instead of `UTC`.

## Schedule
* 1 Hour

## Agents Used
* Website Agent
* Data Output Agent
* Phantom Js Cloud Agent

## End Outputs:
* RSS

## Credentials used:
* `phantomjscloud_api_key`
